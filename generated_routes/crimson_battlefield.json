The Battle of the Hornburg was a significant conflict during the War of the Ring, fought between the Rohirrim and Saruman's forces on March 3-4, T.A. 3019. The Rohirrim, led by Théoden and Erkenbrand, successfully defended against the attacking forces from Isengard, showcasing their bravery and strategic prowess. The fortifications of Isengard and Helm's Deep were originally built by Elendil and the Numenoreans to project power over the native men of Middle-earth, rather than solely for defense against Sauron.\",\n      \"finalAnswer\": {\n        \"distance\": 25,\n        \"unit\": \"mi\"\n      },\n      \"finalAnswerQuality\": \"5\",\n      \"relevantLinks\": [\n        \"https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Battle_of_the_Hornburg\",\n        \"https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/nk38yi/helms_deep_and_isengard_as_colonial_forts_never/\"\n      ],\n      \"mostUsefulAnswers\": [\n        {\n          \"answerQualityExplanation\": \"The answer provides key details about the Battle of the Hornburg, which is directly relevant to the query about the relationship between the Hornburg and Isengard.\",\n          \"answer\": \"The Battle of the Hornburg was fought between the Rohirrim and Saruman's forces at Helm's Deep on March 3-4, T.A. 3019, resulting in a Rohirrim victory.\",\n          \"answerQuality\": \"5\",\n          \"snippet\": \"The Battle of the Hornburg took place at the mountain fortress of the Hornburg in the valley of Helm's Deep in Rohan.
