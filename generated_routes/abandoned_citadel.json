I truly feel like the way we visited Angkor was perfect! So. if you wondering: what temples should you visit at Angkor Wat and how to avoid the crowds? Here’s how I did it!\\n\\nDAY 1:\\nSUNRISE AT ANGKOR WAT:\\n\\nAsk your hotel to serve you an early breakfast… and I mean early! I ended up having breakfast at 4 am and leaving around 4:50. We already had tickets, so that saved us time in the morning. The tuktuk driver we had hired arrived at the hostel and we set off to catch the sunrise in Angkor Wat. We arrived with the rest of the crowd. However, it was not nearly as bad as I had expected. We were able to get a nice spot to watch the sunrise and our plan for avoiding the crowds the rest of the day worked like a charm.\\n\\nTA PROMH:\\n\\nAfter enjoying a lovely sunrise we decided not to explore Angkor Wat right away. Everybody that had just watched the sunrise was about to head in, so we headed towards Ta Promh. We hadn’t realized that the temple wasn’t officially open yet, so for about 30 minutes we had famous tomb raider temple all to ourselves. We explored for almost 2 hours.\\n\\nBAYON:\\n\\nWe arrived at Bayon around 9:00 am. Even though there were a few people there, it was still relatively quiet. Only around 09:30 we saw some crowds starting to form. This temple is located in the heart of Angkor Thom. Bayon is known for its enigmatic stone faces at the top of the towers, looking down on its visitors. The Bayon temple was built in the late 12th century by King Jayavarman VII. Bayon served as his state temple and is dedicated to Buddhism. The 54 towers are adorned with over 200 smiling faces, thought to represent either the king himself or the Bodhisattva of compassion.\\n\\nBANTEAY KDEI:\\n\\nThis was the last temple we visited before taking a break at 11:00 and returning to Siem Reap. Banteay Kdei, means “Citadel of Chambers,” and is a peaceful and lesser-visited temple. It is located near Ta Prohm. Built in the 12th century, this Buddhist temple features a more understated design compared to some of its grander neighbors, but it’s also very beautiful.\\n\\nWe returned to Siem Reap at 11:00 to avoid the hottest hours of the day. This way we could also enjoy a nice lunch instead of the limited options at the temples. We returned to Angkor after lunch.\\n\\nANGKOR WAT:\\n\\nNow it was finally time to explore Angkor Wat on the inside. We took the entire rest of the afternoon walking around Angkor Wat. Angkor Wat is the crown jewel of Cambodia’s ancient temple complex, and it’s easy to see why. This massive structure, originally built in the 12th century as a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu, later transitioned into an important Buddhist site. There stunning intricate carvings that dept tales from Hindu mythology and the central towers rising above the temple are an iconic sight.\\n\\nDay 2:\\nPru Rup:\\n\\nWe started our day at the Pre Rup temple at 7:30. There was beautiful soft golden morning light. Pre Rup is a striking temple mountain built in the 10th century and offers a glimpse into Angkor’s earlier architectural style. The temple was dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. The temple has three towers sitting at the top and the reddish stone looks beautiful with the golden sunlight at sunrise or sunset.\\n\\nBANTEAY SREI:\\n\\nBanteay Sri is located 25km away from the main temple groups. Tuktuk drivers charge $6 extra to visit this one as its further out. I really wanted to see this one though! Banteay Srei is known for its intricate carvings. This 10th-century temple is smaller than many of the other temples at Angkor, but what it lacks in size, it more than makes up for in the extraordinary detail of its artwork. The delicate carvings of mythological scenes, deities, and floral patterns are some of the finest in all of Angkor. Because of its more remote location, it’s often less crowded.\\n\\nTA SOM:\\n\\nNext up was Ta Som. This is a charming, smaller temple that offers a peaceful respite from the busier sites within the Angkor complex. Built in the late 12th century by King Jayavarman VII, Ta Som is known for its picturesque gateway, where a massive strangler fig tree has taken over the eastern entrance (gopura).\\n\\nPREAH KHAN TEMPLE\\n\\nThis temple was most famous for the enormous tree growing on top of it, but they had it cut down in 2022. Even though that was a small disappointment, the temple was still beautiful and worth a vist. Preah Khan’s served as a centre for worship and learning. The temple was dedicated to a whopping number of 515 divinities. During the course of a year 18 major festivals took place here. It required a team of thousands just to maintain the place.\\n\\nPHNOM BAKHENG FOR SUNSET\\n\\nWhile we were there this was the only temple that was open for sunset. I recommend arriving early, because it gets very crowded, making it difficult to find a nice spot to sit. Phnom Bakheng temple sits on top of a hill and offers some of the best panoramic views over Angkor. It was built at the end of the 9th century and originally dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva.\",\n        \"content\": \"The content provides a detailed itinerary for a two-day visit to the Angkor temple complex, including specific temples to visit, the best times to visit them to avoid crowds, and additional tips for making the most of the experience.

There stunning intricate carvings that dept tales from Hindu mythology and the central towers rising above the temple are an iconic sight.\\n\\nDay 2:\\nPru Rup:\\n\\nWe started our day at the Pre Rup temple at 7:30. There was beautiful soft golden morning light. Pre Rup is a striking temple mountain built in the 10th century and offers a glimpse into Angkor’s earlier architectural style. The temple was dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. The temple has three towers sitting at the top and the reddish stone looks beautiful with the golden sunlight at sunrise or sunset.\\n\\nBANTEAY SREI:\\n\\nBanteay Sri is located 25km away from the main temple groups. Tuktuk drivers charge $6 extra to visit this one as its further out. I really wanted to see this one though! Banteay Srei is known for its intricate carvings. This 10th-century temple is smaller than many of the other temples at Angkor, but what it lacks in size, it more than makes up for in the extraordinary detail of its artwork. The delicate carvings of mythological scenes, deities, and floral patterns are some of the finest in all of Angkor. Because of its more remote location, it’s often less crowded.\\n\\nTA SOM:\\n\\nNext up was Ta Som. This is a charming, smaller temple that offers a peaceful respite from the busier sites within the Angkor complex. Built in the late 12th century by King Jayavarman VII, Ta Som is known for its picturesque gateway, where a massive strangler fig tree has taken over the eastern entrance (gopura).\\n\\nPREAH KHAN TEMPLE\\n\\nThis temple was most famous for the enormous tree growing on top of it, but they had it cut down in 2022. Even though that was a small disappointment, the temple was still beautiful and worth a vist. Preah Khan’s served as a centre for worship and learning. The temple was dedicated to a whopping number of 515 divinities. During the course of a year 18 major festivals took place here. It required a team of thousands just to maintain the place.\\n\\nPHNOM BAKHENG FOR SUNSET\\n\\nWhile we were there this was the only temple that was open for sunset. I recommend arriving early, because it gets very crowded, making it difficult to find a nice spot to sit. Phnom Bakheng temple sits on top of a hill and offers some of the best panoramic views over Angkor. It was built at the end of the 9th century and originally dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva.\",\n          \"content\": \"The content provides a detailed itinerary for a two-day visit to the Angkor temple complex, including specific temples to visit, the best times to visit them to avoid crowds, and additional tips for making the most of the experience.

I truly feel like the way we visited Angkor was perfect! So. if you wondering: what temples should you visit at Angkor Wat and how to avoid the crowds? Here’s how I did it!\\n\\nDAY 1:\\nSUNRISE AT ANGKOR WAT:\\n\\nAsk your hotel to serve you an early breakfast… and I mean early! I ended up having breakfast at 4 am and leaving around 4:50. We already had tickets, so that saved us time in the morning. The tuktuk driver we had hired arrived at the hostel and we set off to catch the sunrise in Angkor Wat. We arrived with the rest of the crowd. However, it was not nearly as bad as I had expected. We were able to get a nice spot to watch the sunrise and our plan for avoiding the crowds the rest of the day worked like a charm.\\n\\nTA PROMH:\\n\\nAfter enjoying a lovely sunrise we decided not to explore Angkor Wat right away. Everybody that had just watched the sunrise was about to head in, so we headed towards Ta Promh. We hadn’t realized that the temple wasn’t officially open yet, so for about 30 minutes we had famous tomb raider temple all to ourselves. We explored for almost 2 hours.\\n\\nBAYON:\\n\\nWe arrived at Bayon around 9:00 am. Even though there were a few people there, it was still relatively quiet. Only around 09:30 we saw some crowds starting to form. This temple is located in the heart of Angkor Thom. Bayon is known for its enigmatic stone faces at the top of the towers, looking down on its visitors. The Bayon temple was built in the late 12th century by King Jayavarman VII. Bayon served as his state temple and is dedicated to Buddhism. The 54 towers are adorned with over 200 smiling faces, thought to represent either the king himself or the Bodhisattva of compassion.\\n\\nBANTEAY KDEI:\\n\\nThis was the last temple we visited before taking a break at 11:00 and returning to Siem Reap. Banteay Kdei, means “Citadel of Chambers,” and is a peaceful and lesser-visited temple. It is located near Ta Prohm. Built in the 12th century, this Buddhist temple features a more understated design compared to some of its grander neighbors, but it’s also very beautiful.\\n\\nWe returned to Siem Reap at 11:00 to avoid the hottest hours of the day. This way we could also enjoy a nice lunch instead of the limited options at the temples. We returned to Angkor after lunch.\\n\\nANGKOR WAT:\\n\\nNow it was finally time to explore Angkor Wat on the inside. We took the entire rest of the afternoon walking around Angkor Wat. Angkor Wat is the crown jewel of Cambodia’s ancient temple complex, and it’s easy to see why. This massive structure, originally built in the 12th century as a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu, later transitioned into an important Buddhist site. There stunning intricate carvings that dept tales from Hindu mythology and the central towers rising above the temple are an iconic sight.\\n\\nDay 2:\\nPru Rup:\\n\\nWe started our day at the Pre Rup temple at 7:30.
